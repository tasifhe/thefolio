/* ===== LEGACY SUPPORT & OVERRIDES ===== */
/* This file contains any remaining styles not moved to modular files */
/* It will be gradually phased out as the modular system is completed */

/* Any additional custom styles that don't fit into the modular structure can go here */
/* This file should remain minimal and only contain truly global overrides */

/* Example of styles that might remain here:
   - Third-party plugin overrides
   - Legacy browser compatibility fixes
   - Temporary patches during migration
*/
